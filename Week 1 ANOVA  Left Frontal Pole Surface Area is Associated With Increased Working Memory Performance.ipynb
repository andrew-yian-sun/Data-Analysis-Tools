This was in contrast with verbal working memory, which was not found to correlate with cortical surface area in this region. I wanted to see if how this association would hold up with another measure of working memory, the n-back task.\n","\n","Therefore, I used data from the Human Connectome Project and ran an ANOVA to see if there were significant differences between n-back task accuracy across 4 levels (quartiles) of left frontal pole surface area. Interestingly, results showed that greater surface area was positively associated with accuracy on the n-back tasks."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IfCRqjFadIpk"},"source":["# Intro"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qXNYXIdoI4eW"},"source":["## Data Explanation\n","I decided to use the behavioral dataset from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), which includes demographic information, performance on various tasks, and measures of brain structure/function for 1206 young participants (ages 22-35).

However, if the conclusions of both these analyses are accurate, there's an interesting question as to why the relationship between left frontal pole surface area flips with these 2 different modalities. Zacharopoulos et al make it clear that the association they find is specific only to visuospatial working memory, and not another measure like verbal working memory (digit span), which did not correlate with left frontal pole surface area in their study.\n","\n","Further questions:\n","1. **Do other regions have similar associations?:** The HCP dataset includes 34 areas on each hemisphere of the brain that have surface area measurements, as well as additional measurements for cortical thickness and volume, so further analysis with this method could easily be scripted.\n","2. **Is this region specific for working memory?:** Because working memory is a higher-order function, it would be unsurprising to see this region associated with other cognitive functions.\n","3. **Is this a causal relationship?:** Maybe a TMS study could help determine whether this region is necessary for working memory."]}]}
